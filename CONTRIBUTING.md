# How Can I Contribute?

## Issue tracking

If you experience any issues regarding strange behaviour please report them, however make sure that the following criteria are met:

* Issue clearly states what the problem is
* Steps to reproduce the issue are added
* Both current and expected behaviours are explained

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome, however it is usually useful to talk with a contributor by opening an issue first so all the technical 
details can be fleshed out and you do not risk your PR from being turned down.
